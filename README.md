This project uses Terraform to automate the provisioning of a local Docker container, illustrating basic DevOps practices.

An Nginx web server operating inside a Docker container is defined, created, and managed using a declarative configuration file (main.tf) in accordance with the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. All code and logs are version-controlled using Git, and the project covers the entire infrastructure lifecycle, from creation (apply) to destruction (destroy).
